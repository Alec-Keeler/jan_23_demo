Start with express?
    initialize node
    Install necessary packages
        express
        nodemon
    Add an app.js
    initialize express
    tell app to listen to a port
    add a couple of script to start the server
    test our server (create end point)

Pieces of an end point (route, route handler, router (:())
    method of the request
        GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE
        additional methods in app object
            all, use (special)
    path of the request
        path needs to be string, RegEx, array or strings (or RegEx)
    how to respond
        send - responds with plain text or json depending on what is passed to it
        json - sends JSON every time
        status - set status of response (pass in a value)
        redirect - allows us to redirect the user to a predefined route
        render - allows cool stuff like html templating

Getting info from client
    req.body (requires app.use(express.json()))
    route params
